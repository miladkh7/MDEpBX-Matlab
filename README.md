# MDEpBX-Matlab
Using the differential evolution Matlab code available on the original website, a modified differential evolution (DE/curr-to-gr_best/1) with p best crossover has been implemented. The link to the publication is http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-17563-3_15 .
This is included as I_strategy number 7, as the original distribution includes 6 strategies.
The code is currently slow and has not been profiled. This is my first attempt at writing an algorithm, so any suggestions and corrections would also be appreciated.
